This project investigates the "Airline Passenger Satisfaction" Kaggle dataset to ascertain key drivers of passenger satisfaction. Using hypothesis testing, logistic regression, and informative visualizations, we discovered that flight delays at arrival, inflight entertainment quality, travel class, and customer loyalty are key drivers of satisfaction. Despite model specification and heteroscedasticity problems, our findings offer actionable recommendations for improving airline services and predictive modeling.
